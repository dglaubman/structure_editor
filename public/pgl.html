<h1>Position Language (PL)</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version 2. 1/30/2014</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>A (loss) Position represents a named collection of losses, and an operation which writes to this collection. There are six types of positions, corresponding to the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Group -- groups the losses from one or more input positions.</li>
<li>Invert -- inverts its input position.</li>
<li>Scale -- multiplies each loss from its input position by a constant factor</li>
<li>Contract -- applies a specified contract payout function to its subject (input) position.</li>
<li>Filter -- applies a predicate function to its input position. Losses for which the predicate is true are written to the position.</li>
<li>Branch -- chooses one of its two input positions, based on a criterion. One of the positions may be marked as the default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Positions may be created, retrieved, modified, or deleted via the API.
(Note: Contract positions are managed indirectly thru Contracts API.)</p>

<p>A Position corresponds to a node in a directed acyclic graph, where the edges consist of arrows from the position to its input position(s).
Given a Position (or set of Positions), the API also supports retrieving the subgraph of dependent positions.</p>

<h2>Grammar</h2>

<pre><code>    structure := STRUCTURE name positions contracts
    positions :=  POSITIONS position-list
    position-list := position | positions position  
    position := name IS position-expression  
    position-expression := grouping | scale | filter | leaf  

    group := group PLUS group | group MINUS group | name  
    scale := scalar TIMES name  
    filter := name DIV criteria  
    leaf := URI | AMOUNT  
    contracts := contract | contracts contract  
    contract := CONTRACT cdl
