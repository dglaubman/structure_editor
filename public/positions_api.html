<h1>Positions API</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Version 2. 1/21/2014</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Position</h2>

<p>A (loss) Position represents a named collection of losses, and an operation which writes to this collection. There are six types of positions, corresponding to the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Group -- groups the losses from one or more input positions.</li>
<li>Invert -- inverts its input position.</li>
<li>Scale -- multiplies each loss from its input position by a constant factor</li>
<li>Contract -- applies a specified contract payout function to its subject (input) position.</li>
<li>Filter -- applies a predicate function to its input position. Losses for which the predicate is true are written to the position.</li>
<li>Branch -- chooses one of its two input positions, based on a criterion. One of the positions may be marked as the default.</li>
</ul>

<p>Positions may be created, retrieved, modified, or deleted via the API.  git add s
(Note: Contract positions are managed indirectly thru Contracts API.)</p>

<p>A Position corresponds to a node in a directed acyclic graph, where the edges consist of arrows from the position to its input position(s).
Given a Position (or set of Positions), the API also supports retrieving the subgraph of dependent positions.</p>

<h3>Creation</h3>

<h3><code>POST /positions</code></h3>

<p>Creates a new position.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: Name, Namespace, Operation are required. Most operations require exactly one input position. Scale and contract have operation specific param. <br />
  <strong>Output</strong>: A representation of  the newly created Position resource <br />
  <strong>Validations</strong>:  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fully qualified name ("namespace:name") must be unique within tenant (else HTTP error 409). <br />
    Input positions must exist, but may be of any type. <br />
    Output position must not exist prior to the POST. <br />
    Other validations differ by position type (see examples)  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h4>Examples:</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Creating a leaf position</strong> <br />
  A leaf position is a group with no children. <br />
  As such, its source of loss is external to Position DB (for example, a CSE) <br />
  We can augment this resource with an external identifier of its source, if this proves useful.  </p>

<h2>Position Graph</h2>

<p>This is a read/only API and thus supports GET. A possible end-point is /positions/graph, also providing a search string which corresponds to one or more positions. <br />
The output is a list containing the transitive closure of the search results and their subject positions (possibly limited by a depth param).  </p>

<h3><code>GET /positions/graph?search-str</code></h3>

<h4>Example</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>* Get the position graph starting from My:Cat1 *</em></p>
